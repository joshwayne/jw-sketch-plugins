# Sketch Plugins

This is a collection of plugins I've created for Bohemian Coding's sweet design app [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

## 1. Text Plugins

### Split Text Lines to Layers
Takes the currently selected text layer and splits each text line to its own separate layer. 

### Combine Text Layers
Takes a group of selected text layers and combines the text to a single layer.

## 2. Page Plugins

### View Previous/Next Page
Simple plugin to add keyboard shortcuts to view the previous/next page
